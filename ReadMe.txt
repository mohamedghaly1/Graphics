Blitz Adventure Odyssey is an immersive gaming experience spanning two levels. In the first level, players aim to collect a minimum of 50 tickets from arcade and video games while navigating through obstacles that deduct tickets upon collision. 
Upon reaching the ticket threshold and within the time limit, players progress to level 2. Here, the focus shifts to physical games, challenging players to gather 10 or more coins before the timer expires. 
A conclusive game status is displayed at the conclusion of the time limit or when players achieve the coin target, marking progression to the second level objective.

    CONSOLE APPLICATION : OpenGL3DTemplate Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this OpenGL3DTemplate application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your OpenGL3DTemplate application.


OpenGL3DTemplate.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

OpenGL3DTemplate.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

OpenGL3DTemplate.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named OpenGL3DTemplate.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
